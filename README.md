<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](screenshot_mobile.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- I am a bit confused when dealing header text with large screen. The problem has solved until add one more specific screen query.
```css
/* X-Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up) */
  @media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
    .card__header {
      width: 60%;
    }
  }
```
- Learned how to center bottom an element
```css
.attribution {
  position: absolute;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  text-align: center;
}
```
